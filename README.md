1.	Description 
The Car Rental Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to facilitate the efficient management of a vehicle rental business. It encompasses various functionalities to streamline the rental process, manage vehicles, handle customer interactions, and provide insightful analytics for business optimization. This system targets rental agencies, offering an end-to-end solution to handle bookings, vehicle availability, billing, and customer service.
2.	Purpose of the Project:
Efficient Vehicle Management: The system should allow easy registration, categorization, and maintenance tracking of various vehicles available for rent.

Customer Management: Maintain a comprehensive database of customers, including their details, rental history, preferences, and payment information.

Reservation System: Implement a booking system that allows customers to reserve vehicles for specific dates, along with the ability to modify or cancel bookings.

Inventory and Availability: Real-time monitoring of available vehicles, their types, models, rental rates, and their status (e.g., rented, available, in maintenance).

Billing and Payments: Generate invoices, calculate rental charges based on duration, additional services, and manage payments (cash, card, online).

Reporting and Analytics: Provide insights through reports on revenue, popular vehicle types, peak booking times, etc., aiding in decision-making.

Expected Outcome:
•	User-friendly Interface: Intuitive interfaces for both customers and staff to navigate the system easily.
•	Efficiency and Automation: Automate processes wherever possible to reduce manual work, such as generating invoices, tracking vehicle maintenance schedules, etc.
•	Reliability and Security: Ensure data security, backups, and reliability of the system to prevent any data loss or unauthorized access.
•	Enhanced Customer Experience: Enable customers to easily find, book, and manage their rentals, leading to increased satisfaction and retention.
•	Improved Management: Provide tools for management to track business performance, monitor inventory, and make informed decisions.

Specific Constraints or Limitations:
•	Security and Privacy: Compliance with data protection laws and regulations to safeguard customer information. 
•	Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of vehicles, customers, and transactions without performance degradation.
•	Integration and Compatibility: Compatibility with different platforms and devices, and possibly integration with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, accounting software).
•	Resource Constraints: Consider budget, time, and technological limitations for development and implementation.
•	Maintenance and Support: Plan for ongoing maintenance, updates, and user support to ensure the system's smooth operation post-implementation.

3. Resources:
IN MY POJECT I USED THE Database named carrent_db Which contain 4 tables (cardetails, useraccess, user,  carrent)


 2 non-functional (non-domain specific) features of my web-application. 
✓ I was able to encrypt the user’s password (This is in case of security). It is possible that admin  may view the user’s password so they can misuse  their account which is why is decided to encrypt the  password 
✓ another non-functional feature is that it is easy to  use Given the consumers' level of understanding, a  basic yet high-quality user interface should be  created to make it simple to comprehend and need  minimal training
✓ Performance and Response Time: The system has a high-performance rate while executing user input  and it is able to offer feedback or a response in a  short amount of time, often 50 seconds for  extremely difficult activities and 20 to 25 seconds  for less sophisticated jobs. 
I used: 
NetBeans server: Glassfish 4.1.1 
Language: JSF (MVC framework) 
Library: Hibernate 
Connection: MySQL
